## Vactrol VCA

You can never have enough VCAs, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with having VCAs with a bit of character - everything from the crisp sound of a THAT2180 to the fuzzed-out lo-fi gnarr from a single transistor. Here we have something that occupies the middle ground, along with its OTA-based sibling.

There's nothing particularly groundbreaking here - we're using a vactrol and an op-amp as the gain cell, with an additional amplification stage immediately afterwards to provide a bit of overdrive should that be your idea of a good time.

Don't expect super snappy responses though, since you're not going to get them - remember, we're using a vactrol. That being said, I find that this is a good fit for more ambient, spacey stuff where the vactrol's inherent lag can be used to it's best advantage. Again, like its OTA sibling, it's far from perfect, but it's the good type of imperfect.
